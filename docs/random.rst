Radom sample test
=============================

To compare the output of contact intensity, HiCmapTools performs random sampling with specified times (--random). Random samples are generated by keeping the distance or size of the query and shifting its position. HiCmapTools performs the same query mode using those random sites and outputs in exmaple.txt file.
Then, we could visualize the density curve of intensity of those queries where the intensity of query is highlighted in the plot (plot.pdf) by following command:
::
    Rscript tools/visualizeRandomTest.R example.txt plot.pdf
An example of the plot is shown.

---
After executing any command, besides the result, HiCmappTools generate a file called “example.txt” that includes the assigned random size. 
2.	To test whether the information in your output file is convincible, you can use the program called “normality_test.R” that can help you to test the normality of data. For instances:
   Rscript  normality_test.R  example.txt
3.	After executing the command, you will get the output of the test, and one density plot called “Distribution of random data”

If the random data are normal distribution, we can assume the rank info
are convinced.

Therefore, our tool are supported to examine normal distribution,
following the command:

    Rscript tools/normality\_test.R temp\_random.txt outputname

You will get the exam ouput message and a PDF file contains three plot.
